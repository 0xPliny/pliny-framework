> [What problem are we solving? Why does it matter?]

### Current State

- Existing systems:
- Pain points:
- Constraints:

### Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Needs | Priority |

### Research Questions

- [ ] What similar systems exist?
- [ ] What technologies are available?
- [ ] What are the scale requirements?
- [ ] What are the security requirements?

### Findings
