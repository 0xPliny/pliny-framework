# PlinyHub Learning Persistence Template
# 
# PURPOSE: Manually persist learnings across sessions
# USAGE: Copy this template, fill in after each significant task
# LOCATION: Store in project root or dedicated learnings folder
#
# To use in future sessions, reference this file:
#   "Load learnings from LEARNINGS.yaml before starting"

#     key_decisions:
#       - decision: "Increase DCB timeout from 30s to 45s"
#         rationale: "PLC response time slower during peak load"
#     final_outcome: "Store commands now succeed consistently"

#   
#   new_discoveries:
#     - discovery: "DCB timeouts often caused by PLC load"
#       applies_to: "All crane communication issues"
#   
#   anti_patterns:
#     - pattern: "Assuming database issue for GP.BAD"
#       why_bad: "GP.BAD often indicates communication, not data"
#       alternative: "Check cs_log for timeout/communication messages first"

#     - "stacker-crane"
#     - "GP.BAD"
#     - "DCB-timeout"

#   
#   notes: |
#     If timeout keeps increasing, investigate PLC program load.
#     Consider adding response time monitoring to catch this earlier.
