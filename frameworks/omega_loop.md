# OMEGA Loop - Self-Improving Master Loop

**Version:** 1.0
**Purpose:** Meta-learning system that makes the entire framework self-improving

---

## Overview

The OMEGA Loop is the **outermost loop** that wraps around ALL framework execution. Every time you complete a task using R-I-S-E, C-A-R-E, or HARVEST, OMEGA captures what was learned.

## The Six Phases

| Phase | Purpose | Key Actions |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **O**BSERVE | Gather data about problem and environment | Collect inputs, context, constraints, prior attempts |
| **M**ODEL | Build mental model of the problem space | Identify patterns, relationships, dependencies |
| **E**XECUTE | Apply chosen framework to solve problem | Run R-I-S-E, C-A-R-E, or HARVEST |
| **G**ENERATE | Produce solution and artifacts | Create code, documentation, analysis |
| **A**NALYZE | Evaluate results against expectations | Compare output to requirements, measure quality |
| **(learn)** | Extract and store lessons for future | Record successes, failures, new patterns |

## Mathematical Foundation

### Error Convergence Formula

```
Error(n) = Error(0) × (1 - learning_rate)^n

Where:
  Error(0)      = Initial error rate (typically 0.3-0.5 for new domains)
  learning_rate = Rate of improvement per iteration (typically 0.1-0.3)
  n             = Number of iterations

As n → ∞, Error → 0
```

### Convergence Examples

| Scenario | Initial Error | Learning Rate | After 5 | After 10 | After 20 |
|----------|--------------|---------------|---------|----------|----------|
| New domain | 40% | 0.20 | 13.1% | 4.3% | 0.5% |
| Familiar domain | 20% | 0.25 | 4.7% | 1.1% | 0.06% |
| Very complex | 50% | 0.15 | 22.2% | 9.9% | 1.9% |

**Key insight:** Even with modest learning rates, errors compound down to near-zero given enough iterations.

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: OBSERVE

**Purpose:** Gather all available data before modeling

```yaml
observe:
  inputs:
    - problem_statement: "[User's description]"
    - context: "[Files, documentation, environment]"
    - constraints: "[Time, resources, requirements]"
    - prior_attempts: "[Previous solutions tried]"
    - relevant_learnings: "[Past lessons that apply]"
    
  outputs:
    - observation_summary: "[Structured understanding]"
    - missing_info: "[What we don't know yet]"
    - assumptions: "[What we're assuming is true]"
```

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Problem statement is clear
- [ ] Context is fully loaded
- [ ] Constraints are understood
- [ ] Prior attempts reviewed
- [ ] Relevant past learnings retrieved

---

### Phase 2: MODEL

**Purpose:** Build accurate mental model of problem space

```yaml
model:
  inputs:
    - observation_summary
    - missing_info
    - assumptions
    
  process:
    - classify_problem: "[CREATION|TRANSFORMATION|UNDERSTANDING|REPAIR|OPTIMIZATION]"
    - identify_patterns: "[What patterns apply?]"
    - map_dependencies: "[What depends on what?]"
    - predict_challenges: "[What could go wrong?]"
    
  outputs:
    - problem_model: "[Structured problem representation]"
    - approach_recommendations: "[Suggested frameworks/strategies]"
    - risk_assessment: "[Potential failure modes]"
```

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Problem correctly classified
- [ ] Relevant patterns identified
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Risks assessed
- [ ] Framework selected

---

### Phase 3: EXECUTE

**Purpose:** Apply selected framework to solve problem

```yaml
execute:
  inputs:
    - problem_model
    - selected_framework: "[R-I-S-E | C-A-R-E | HARVEST]"
    - domain_module: "[loaded standards]"
    
  process:
    - run_framework_phases: "[Execute all phases]"
    - apply_domain_standards: "[Follow loaded module]"
    - iterate_as_needed: "[Loop if quality insufficient]"
    
  outputs:
    - execution_log: "[What was done at each step]"
    - intermediate_results: "[Results from each phase]"
```

**This phase contains the Core Loop (CLASSIFY → FRAMEWORK → VERIFY)**

---

### Phase 4: GENERATE

**Purpose:** Produce final solution and artifacts

```yaml
generate:
  inputs:
    - execution_log
    - intermediate_results
    
  process:
    - synthesize_solution: "[Combine results into final form]"
    - create_artifacts: "[Code, docs, analysis]"
    - document_decisions: "[Why choices were made]"
    
  outputs:
    - solution: "[The actual deliverable]"
    - artifacts: "[Supporting materials]"
    - decision_log: "[Reasoning trail]"
```

---

### Phase 5: ANALYZE

**Purpose:** Evaluate quality and identify improvements

```yaml
analyze:
  inputs:
    - solution
    - original_requirements
    - quality_gates: "[From domain module]"
    
  process:
    - measure_quality: "[Run quality gates]"
    - compare_to_requirements: "[Check all requirements met]"
    - identify_gaps: "[What could be better?]"
    - calculate_efficiency: "[Time, iterations, quality metrics]"
    
  outputs:
    - quality_score: "[0.0-1.0]"
    - gap_analysis: "[What's missing or suboptimal]"
    - efficiency_metrics: "[Performance data]"
```

**Quality Scoring:**

```
completeness_score = (requirements_met / total_requirements)
accuracy_score     = (correct_items / total_items)
consistency_score  = (consistent_items / total_items)

overall_quality = (completeness × 0.4) + (accuracy × 0.4) + (consistency × 0.2)
```

---

### Phase 6: LEARN (The Key Phase)

**Purpose:** Extract and persist lessons for future

```yaml
learn:
  inputs:
    - execution_log
    - quality_score
    - gap_analysis
    
  extract:
    - successful_patterns: "[What worked well]"
    - failed_attempts: "[What didn't work and why]"
    - new_discoveries: "[Novel patterns found]"
    - efficiency_insights: "[What could be faster]"
    
  persist:
    - add_to_knowledge_base: true
    - update_pattern_library: true
    - adjust_confidence_scores: true
    
  outputs:
    - learning_record: "[Structured YAML record]"
    - knowledge_base_updated: true
```

## Key Properties

1. **Monotonic Improvement:** Each iteration reduces expected error
2. **Knowledge Persistence:** Learnings survive across sessions
3. **Pattern Recognition:** Past solutions inform future approaches
4. **Failure Prevention:** Anti-patterns are explicitly avoided
5. **Self-Correction:** System identifies and fixes its own weaknesses

**The framework literally gets smarter with every use.**
