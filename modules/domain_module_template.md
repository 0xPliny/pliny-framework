# Domain Module Template

**Version:** 1.0
**Purpose:** Standard structure for creating pluggable domain modules

---

## Overview

Domain modules inject domain-specific standards, quality gates, and personas into universal frameworks. This template defines the required structure.

## Creating a New Module

### Step 1: Identify Domain

- What file types does it cover?
- What keywords signal this domain?
- What context identifies it?

### Step 2: Define Standards

- What MUST be done? (required)
- What MUST NOT be done? (forbidden)
- What SHOULD be done? (recommended)

### Step 3: Set Quality Gates

- How do you measure completeness?
- How do you verify accuracy?
- What does consistency mean?
- Are there domain-specific checks?

### Step 4: Create Personas

- Who is the expert in this domain?
- What is their expertise?
- How do they work/communicate?

### Step 5: Document Patterns

- What patterns solve common problems?
- What anti-patterns cause issues?
- What examples illustrate correct usage?

### Step 6: Test the Module

- Apply to sample problems
- Verify standards catch violations
- Check quality gates trigger appropriately
- Confirm persona guidance is useful

## Module Validation Checklist

Before publishing a module:

- [ ] Metadata complete and accurate
- [ ] At least 3 required standards defined
- [ ] At least 2 forbidden patterns defined
- [ ] Quality gates have reasonable thresholds
- [ ] At least 1 persona defined with prompt
- [ ] At least 2 common patterns documented
- [ ] At least 1 anti-pattern documented
- [ ] Good and bad examples provided
- [ ] Tested on 3+ representative problems
- [ ] Documentation is clear and complete

---

## Module Loading

```bash
# Load a module
pliny module load [domain_name]

# View loaded module
pliny module show

# List available modules
pliny module list

# Validate a module
pliny module validate [path/to/module.yaml]
```

---

## Integration with Frameworks

When a module is loaded, its contents inject into frameworks:

### In R-I-S-E (Execute phase)

```
Execute with [DOMAIN_STANDARDS] ← From module.standards
Apply [QUALITY_GATES] ← From module.quality_gates
Use [PERSONA] as guide ← From module.personas
```

### In C-A-R-E (Respond + Evaluate phases)

```
Respond: Apply [DOMAIN_STANDARDS] ← From module.standards
Evaluate: Check [QUALITY_GATES] ← From module.quality_gates
```

### In Problem Classifier

```
Match [applicable_to] to detect domain ← From module.applicable_to
```
