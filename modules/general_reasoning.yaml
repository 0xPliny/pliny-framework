# ============================================
# PATTERNS
# ============================================
common_patterns:
  - name: "First Principles Analysis"
    category: "reasoning"
    problem: "Need to solve a novel problem without relying on conventions"
    solution: |
      1. Identify the fundamental truths (what do we KNOW to be true?)
      2. Question every assumption (why do we believe this?)
      3. Build up from basics (what can we derive from fundamentals?)
      4. Avoid reasoning by analogy too early (don't assume this is like X)
    example: |
      Question: "How should we price our new product?"
      
      First Principles approach:
      1. Fundamentals: 
         - Value = benefits to customer / cost to customer
         - Price must cover our costs for sustainability
         - Price signals quality perception
      
      2. Question assumptions:
         - "Competitors charge X" → But are we solving same problem?
         - "Industry norm is $Y" → But is that optimal or just convention?
      
      3. Build from basics:
         - Calculate our cost structure
         - Measure actual value delivered to customer
         - Test different price points experimentally

  - name: "5 Whys Root Cause"
    category: "analysis"
    problem: "Finding the root cause of a problem"
    solution: |
      Keep asking "why" (typically 5 times) to reach root cause
    example: |
      Problem: Customer complaints increased
      
      Why 1: Response times are slow → Why?
      Why 2: Support team is overwhelmed → Why?
      Why 3: Ticket volume doubled last month → Why?
      Why 4: New feature has many bugs → Why?
      Why 5: Insufficient testing before release → ROOT CAUSE
      
      Solution: Improve QA process, not hire more support staff

  - name: "Decision Matrix"
    category: "decision"
    problem: "Choosing between multiple options with various criteria"
    solution: |
      Create weighted scoring matrix to compare objectively
    example: |
      | Criteria      | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C |
      |---------------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
      | Cost          | 30%    | 8 (2.4)  | 5 (1.5)  | 7 (2.1)  |
      | Speed         | 25%    | 6 (1.5)  | 9 (2.25) | 7 (1.75) |
      | Quality       | 25%    | 9 (2.25) | 7 (1.75) | 8 (2.0)  |
      | Risk          | 20%    | 7 (1.4)  | 6 (1.2)  | 8 (1.6)  |
      |---------------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
      | TOTAL         |        | 7.55     | 6.70     | 7.45     |
      
      Recommendation: Option A (highest weighted score)

      ## Analysis: Should We Expand to European Market?
      
      ### Assumptions (stated explicitly)
      1. Current US market growth will continue (10% YoY)
      2. European regulatory compliance cost: ~$500K
      3. No major currency fluctuations (using 6-month average)
      
      ### Multiple Perspectives
      - **Growth view**: EU represents 2x TAM expansion opportunity
      - **Risk view**: Regulatory complexity + currency risk substantial
      - **Resource view**: Current team stretched; expansion could harm core
      
      ### Facts vs. Interpretation
      FACTS:
      - EU SaaS market: $50B (Statista 2024)
      - 3 competitors already established in EU
      - GDPR compliance required
      
      INTERPRETATION:
      - Market may be saturating (competitor presence suggests this)
      - Compliance likely underestimated (typical first-time estimates are 50% low)
      
      ### Recommendation
      **Delay EU expansion 12 months**
      
      Confidence: MEDIUM
      
      Reasoning:
      1. US growth still strong - focus on capturing more here first
      2. Compliance costs likely higher than estimated
      3. Team bandwidth concerns valid
      
      This would change if:
      - US growth stalls below 5%
      - Key enterprise customer requires EU presence
      - Competitor wins major EU contracts
      
      ### Next Steps
      1. Monitor US growth metrics quarterly
      2. Begin GDPR compliance assessment (low cost, reduces future risk)
      3. Revisit decision in Q3 2025

      ## Analysis: EU Expansion
      
      We should definitely expand to Europe because:
      - Everyone else is doing it (our competitors are there)
      - We've already spent $100K on preliminary research
      - Europe is a big market
      
      I'm confident this is the right choice.
    why_bad:
      - "Bandwagon fallacy (everyone is doing it)"
      - "Sunk cost fallacy (we already spent money)"
      - "Vague claim without quantification (big market)"
